# Credit_Risk_and_scorecard_prediction

Credit risk model in Python to predict the probabilities of default (PD) and assign credit scores to existing or potential borrowers. We will determine credit scores using a highly interpretable, easy to understand and implement scorecard that makes calculating the credit score a breeze given certain required information about him and his credit history.

We set a loan approval cut-offs to determine which loans we should approve and reject. deal credit score cut-off point, i.e., potential borrowers with a credit score higher than this cut-off point will be accepted and those less than it will be rejected. This cut-off point should also strike a fine balance between the expected loan approval and rejection rates. Thus we have a complete working PD model and credit scorecard
